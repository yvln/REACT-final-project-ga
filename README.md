## Unsolved problems and major hurdles

- React Native not done (API & design, lack of time)
- Difficulties to put in place Facebook authentication (what to send, how to receive what I need)
- Manage all scenario after game (Level up? Number of tries? Wins or Lose?)
- Update home page info immediately (A lot of callback functions and states created)
